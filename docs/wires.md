# Wires #

In this entry, I will introduce the idea of representing information with numbers or 'bits'.

### What is information? ###
Let's say you have a friend, Bob. 
Bob lives in a room with no windows. 
He doesn't like to go outside or talk to people very much, but he does like to know if it's raining.    
*Question:* How might you create a simple setup that would allow you to tell Bob if it's raining without having to talk to him directly? Let's say that you have some wire, a switch, and a lightbulb.
*Answer:* A pretty simple solution would be to run a wire from a switch somewhere convenient to you to a lightbulb in Bob's room.   
Then, you can easily turn the switch on to let Bob know it is raining, or switch it off to let Bob know that it is not.    
What you have essentially done is created a system that represents a single 'bit' of information. A 'bit' is the smallest piece of useful information possible. It is usually useful for simple yes/no questions. For example, is it raining?
As it turns out, bits are the basis for all of the complicated goings on inside of a normal computer!
